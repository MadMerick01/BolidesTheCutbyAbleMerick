# Bolides – The Cut

### You transport value. Watch the road.

A career expansion for **BeamNG.drive** that introduces crime, risk, and chaos  
into the otherwise safe and predictable. You will need to use strategy in vehicle choice and upgrades

**Bolides – The Cut** is a career add-on for BeamNG.drive designed to work alongside  
**Vanilla Career** and **RLS Career**.

Where traditional career gameplay rewards consistency, safety, and optimisation,  
Bolides – The Cut introduces **unpredictability**.

It is the *yin* to career mode’s *yang*.

In standard career play, you build wealth through planning and discipline.

**Bolides – The Cut exists to disrupt that.**

As you move value across the map, criminal events may unfold:
- Ambushes
- Roadside attacks
- Opportunistic theft
- Vehicle damage at the worst possible moment

Every run carries risk.

The Bolides are a roaming crime gang led by **Bonito Bolide**.

They take interest in anyone who appears to be building a fortune across:
- West Coast USA
- Italy
- Utah
- Any career-enabled BeamNG map

If you look profitable, you look like a target.

This is not a passive punishment system.

Players can:
- Defend their cargo
- Protect their earnings
- Turn the tables

Weapons and equipment may be obtained from the Bolides themselves, including:
- EMP and charges
- Pistols
- Ammunition

Survival is optional. Preparation is not.

### Built for stability

Bolides – The Cut is:
- **~99% Lua-based**
- Independent of BeamNG core code
- Independent of other mods
- Designed to be robust and low-maintenance

This approach ensures the mod:
- Plays well with updates
- Minimises breakage
- Integrates cleanly into existing career saves and other carreer mods

### Current release focus

The initial release focuses on:
- Gang encounters
- Robbery
- Vehicle damage via gunfire
- Player ability to obtain EMP and Pistol
- Strategic use of hard to come by ammo and charges

The system is intentionally modular and expandable.

Bolides – The Cut does not replace career mode.  
It makes surviving it harder.
