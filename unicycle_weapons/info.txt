Player Weapons v2.2
Player weapons mod made by AwesomeCarl. 
Machine gun assets by AgentY.
NOTE: This mod replaces game lua to make the player model visible at all times, and for other features. This may break the game if the devs change this lua in an update.
If you want to make this your default config then just overwrite the "with_mesh" config ("snowman" config if using beammp) with yours in the Save & Load menu.
Feel free to add this mod to your multiplayer servers, but do not claim it as yours.
The minigun, bazooka, superhuman mode and forcefield bullets can be deleted from the mod if you wish by deleting the "minigun" folder in vehicles>unicycle.
