# Bolides – The Cut

### You transport value. Watch the road.

Career mode is no longer safe.

Bolides – The Cut is a career expansion for BeamNG.drive that introduces the Bolides — a hostile criminal gang that turns every profitable run into a potential high-stakes encounter.

EMP attacks. Theft of Career Money. Armed combat by pistol. Mechanical bullet damage with real consequences to driveability and repair costs.

Your decisions determine whether you survive, fight back, or turn danger into profit. Ammo is scarce, use it sparingly

### Strategic Vehicle Configuration

Vehicle setup is critical to your progress — it is functional engineering.

Your build must complete standard career work — cargo transport, value delivery, contracts etc. — while also surviving and responding to hostile encounters.

A pure work configuration may maximise income but increase vulnerability.
A defensive build may improve survivability but reduce efficiency, range, or payload.

Success depends on driving skill and deliberate configuration — balancing payload, durability and mobility.

Every component affects handling.
Every kilogram affects performance.
Every decision affects risk.

The objective is simple: complete the job and keep the earnings.

----------------------------------------------------

**Bolides - The Cut** works on **ALL career enabled maps**

**RLS Career** (recommended - for features and balance).

**FOR Sim-Racers: Beamng.drive has excellent FFB, triple screen and simhub (telemetry) support**

-----------------------------------------------------

## Bolides The Cut Public Release Candidate (0.9 RC)

### Installation Guide

1. Download BolidesTheCutbyAbleMerickPublic_Release_Candidate_(0.9 RC).zip (From Releases)
https://github.com/MadMerick01/BolidesTheCutbyAbleMerick/releases/tag/Public_Release_Candidate

2. Place the downloaded `.zip` file into your BeamNG `mods` folder.  
   *(Do not extract the zip.)*

3. Launch **BeamNG.drive** and start **Career Mode** as normal  
   (RLS Career Highly Recommended).

   **BolideTheCutHUD** app.

-----------------------------------------------------

In standard BeamNG.drive RLS or Vanilla career, you build wealth through planning and discipline.

**Bolides – The Cut exists to disrupt that.**

As you move value across the map, criminal events may unfold:
- Ambushes (EMP disables your vehicle to be robbed)
- Theft (Up to half career money in your wallet)
- Pursuit of Bolide Robber to intercept/disable to gain money back (plus possible extra loot or ammumition)
- Bullet damage at the worst possible moment
- Intimidation
- Drive by shooting
- Pursuit by armed Bolide Vehicle
- NEXT UPDATE: ability to purchase EMP charges and ammo (in RC 0.9 obtain these from intercepting Bolide vehicles)
- many more planned hostile encounters with risk/reward mechanics

The Bolides are a roaming crime gang led by **Bonito Bolide**. Bonito Bolide is the founder of **Bolide Motors** and the unseen head of
the Bolides crime network. Publicly, he is known as an industrialist with property holdings in Italy and interests in high-performance vehicle manufacturing. Privately, his fortune is reinforced through organised criminal operations targeting high-value transport and emerging career operators.

If you are making money on the road, Bonito Bolide is already aware of you.

**Custom Lua AI switching behaviour based on forward thinking**.
The Bolides use a custom lua ai mode and constraint switching to enable for example realistic and safe downhill chases while still preserving good top speed and conservation of momentum in corners. They limit speed when appropriate, lane change and avoid traffic and obstacles. Essentially the Bolides are better drivers than vanilla 'flee' mode. Part of the inspiration of this mod originated in my curious digging into the weeds of the Beamng.drive AI and finding a surprisingly robust set of parameters and road ahead information. Once the core parts of the mod are more robustly implemented I intend to return to keep refining Custom Bolide AI further. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Bolides take an interest in anyone who appears to be building a future across:
- West Coast USA
- Italy
- Utah
- River Highway
- The Gap
- Any other career-enabled RLS BeamNG.drive map

If you look profitable, you look like a target. They want a cut of your earnings.

Players can:
- Defend their vehicle and cargo (EMP and pistol)
- Protect their earnings
- Turn the tables (take back robbed amounts plus extra money, loot, ammo and EMP charges

Weapons and equipment may be obtained from the Bolides themselves, including:
- EMP and charges
- Pistol
- Ammunition

Bolides – The Cut does not replace career mode.  
It makes surviving it harder.
