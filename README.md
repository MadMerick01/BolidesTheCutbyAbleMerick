# Bolides – The Cut

### You transport value. Watch the road.

A career expansion for BeamNG.drive introducing The Bolides, a hostile criminal gang, calculated risk on every run, equipment and weapons. Your strategic choices determine whether you escape, fight back or profit.

----------------------------------------------------

**Bolides - The Cut** works on **ALL career enabled maps**

**RLS Career** (recommended - for features and balance).

**Sim-Racers: Beamng.drive has great FFB, triple screen, VR and simhub (telemetry) support**

-----------------------------------------------------

## Bolides The Cut Public Release Candidate (0.9 RC)

### Installation Guide

1. Download BolidesTheCutbyAbleMerickPublic_Release_Candidate_(0.9 RC).zip (From Releases)
https://github.com/MadMerick01/BolidesTheCutbyAbleMerick/releases/tag/Public_Release_Candidate

2. Place the downloaded `.zip` file into your BeamNG `mods` folder.  
   *(Do not extract the zip.)*

3. Launch **BeamNG.drive** and start **Career Mode** as normal  
   (RLS Career Highly Recommended).

4. Once in-game, open the **UI Apps** menu, go to **General** and add the  
   **BolideTheCutHUD** app.

-----------------------------------------------------

In standard career play, you build wealth through planning and discipline. Transport, taxi, drag builds, workshop and races....

**Bolides – The Cut exists to disrupt that.**

As you move value across the map, criminal events may unfold:
- Ambushes (EMP disables your vehicle to be robbed)
- Theft (up to half money total in your wallet)
- Bullet damage at the worst possible moment
- Intimidation
- NEXT UPDATE: ability to purchase EMP charges and ammo (in RC 0.9 obtain these from intercepting Bolide vehicles)
- many more features to come!!

The Bolides are a roaming crime gang led by **Bonito Bolide**. Bonito Bolide is the founder of **Bolide Motors** and the unseen head of
the Bolides crime network. Publicly, he is known as an industrialist with property holdings in Italy and interests in high-performance vehicle manufacturing. Privately, his fortune is reinforced through organised criminal operations targeting high-value transport and emerging career operators.

If you are making money on the road, Bonito Bolide is already aware of you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
**Custom Lua AI switching behaviour based on forward thinking**.
The Bolides use custom lua ai mode and constraint switching to enable for example safe downhill chases and better safe corner speeds while still preserving good top speed and retention of speed in corners. They limit speed when appropriate, lane change and avoid traffic and obstacles. Essentially the Bolides are better drivers than 'flee' mode vanilla. Part of the inspiration of this mod originated in my curious digging into the weeds of the Beamng.drive AI and finding a surprisingly robust set of parameters and road ahead information. Once the fun parts of the mod are more fleshed out I intend to return to keep refining Bolide AI further. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Bolides take an interest in anyone who appears to be building a future across:
- West Coast USA
- Italy
- Utah
- River Highway
- The Gap
- Any career-enabled RLS BeamNG.drive map

If you look profitable, you look like a target. They want a cut of your earnings.

Players can:
- Defend their vehicle and cargo (EMP and pistol)
- Protect their earnings
- Turn the tables (take back robbed amounts plus extra money, loot, ammo and EMP charges

Weapons and equipment may be obtained from the Bolides themselves, including:
- EMP and charges
- Pistol
- Ammunition

-----------------------------------------------------

### Public & Extended Editions

Bolides – The Cut is available as a free public release, offering the full core
experience — criminal encounters, risk, and consequence within Career Mode.

strategic control and expanded systems, including features such as
