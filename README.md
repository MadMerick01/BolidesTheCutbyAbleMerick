# Bolides – The Cut

### You transport value. Watch the road.

A career expansion for **BeamNG.drive** that introduces crime, risk, and chaos  
into the otherwise safe and predictable. You will need to use strategy in vehicle choice and upgrades

**Bolides – The Cut** is a career add-on for BeamNG.drive designed to work alongside  
**Vanilla Career** and **RLS Career**.

Where traditional career gameplay rewards consistency, safety, and optimisation,  
Bolides – The Cut introduces **unpredictability**.

It is the *yin* to career mode’s *yang*.

In standard career play, you build wealth through planning and discipline.

**Bolides – The Cut exists to disrupt that.**

As you move value across the map, criminal events may unfold:
- Ambushes
- Roadside attacks
- Opportunistic theft
- Vehicle damage at the worst possible moment

Every run carries risk.

The Bolides are a roaming crime gang led by **Bonito Bolide**. 

**Custom AI switching Behaviours based on forward thinking**.
The Bolides use a custom lua trigger based ai switching to enable for example safe downhill chases and better safe corner speeds while still preserving good top speed. Essentially the Bolides will be better drivers and i intend to keep refining this aspect of the mod.

They take interest in anyone who appears to be building a fortune across:
- West Coast USA
- Italy
- Utah
- Any career-enabled BeamNG map

If you look profitable, you look like a target.

This is not a passive punishment system.

Players can:
- Defend their cargo
- Protect their earnings
- Turn the tables

Weapons and equipment may be obtained from the Bolides themselves, including:
- EMP and charges
- Pistols
- Ammunition

Survival is optional. Preparation is not.

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from:
   - **GitHub** (public releases), or  
   - **Patreon** (Extended Edition)

2. Place the downloaded `.zip` file into your BeamNG `mods` folder.  
   *(Do not extract the zip.)*

3. Launch **BeamNG.drive** and start **Career Mode** as normal  
   (Vanilla Career or RLS Career).

4. Once in-game, open the **UI Apps** menu and add the  
   **Bolides – The Cut** app.

You’re ready to go.

The Bolides app automatically initializes each time you load into Career Mode.

### Public & Advanced Editions

Bolides – The Cut is available as a free public release, offering the full core
experience — criminal encounters, risk, and consequence within Career Mode.

An **Advanced Edition** is available via Patreon for players who want deeper
strategic control and expanded systems, including features such as
in-world purchasing of weapons ammo and equipment. New features tbc.

Both editions are stable and supported. Patreon directly funds continued
development and long-term expansion of the project.

### Built for stability

Bolides – The Cut is:
- **~99% Lua-based**
- Independent of BeamNG core code
- Independent of other mods
- Designed to be robust and low-maintenance

This approach ensures the mod:
- Plays well with updates
- Minimises breakage
- Integrates cleanly into existing career saves and other carreer mods

### Current release focus

The initial release focuses on:
- Gang encounters
- Robbery
- Vehicle damage via gunfire
- Player ability to obtain EMP and Pistol
- Strategic use of hard to come by ammo and charges

The system is intentionally modular and expandable.

### Looking ahead

Bolides – The Cut is built on a modular foundation, allowing new crime events,  
AI behaviours, and defensive tools to be introduced over time.

Future updates will expand encounter variety and strategic depth while  
maintaining compatibility with existing career systems.
